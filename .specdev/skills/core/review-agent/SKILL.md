# Review Agent

## Contract

- **Input:** An assignment folder with completed phase outputs
- **Process:** Detect phase → read phase artifacts → holistic review → discuss findings with user
- **Output:** `review/{phase}-feedback.md` with verdict and findings
- **Next:** User communicates findings to the main agent session (or approves)

## How to Launch

User runs `specdev review brainstorm` or `specdev review implementation` in a separate Claude Code session. The command:

1. Detects the active assignment automatically
2. Uses the specified phase to load the review protocol
3. Starts an interactive review session with the user

## Prompts

| Prompt | Purpose | When to dispatch |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `.specdev/skills/core/review-agent/prompts/implementation-reviewer.md` | Review the full implementation holistically | After implementation phase completes |

**Note:** Breakdown plan review is handled by inline subagent review during the breakdown phase, NOT by `specdev review <phase>`. Do not wait for `specdev review` after breakdown — proceed directly to `specdev implement`.

## Review Protocol

### Brainstorm Review

Read `brainstorm/proposal.md` and `brainstorm/design.md`. Check:
- Is the goal clear and specific?
- Does the architecture make sense?
- Are there gaps in the design (missing error handling, unclear data flow)?
- Are the decisions well-reasoned?

### Implementation Review

Use `.specdev/skills/core/review-agent/prompts/implementation-reviewer.md`. Check:
- Does the full implementation match the design?
- Do all tests pass?
- Are there integration issues between tasks?
- Is there scope drift (things built that weren't in the design)?
- Is test coverage adequate?

## Feedback Format

### {phase}-feedback.md (written by review agent)

```markdown
# Review Feedback

**Phase:** breakdown
**Verdict:** approved / needs-changes
**Round:** 1
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-15T10:35:00

## Findings
- [list, or "None — approved"]

## Addressed Findings
- [items fixed in this round, or "None"]
```

## Red Flags

- Nitpicking during holistic review — focus on macro issues, not style
- Approving without reading the actual files — always read the artifacts
- Skipping re-review after fixes — always verify fixes actually address findings

## Multi-Round Review

When `check-review` processes feedback with a `needs-changes` verdict:
1. Main agent addresses findings in the phase artifacts
2. Main agent writes `review/update-round-N.md` summarizing what changed
3. On subsequent `specdev review <phase>` runs, the reviewer sees the update file to focus on what changed
4. Round number increments automatically from archived `feedback-round-N.md` files
5. Loop continues until verdict is `approved`

## Integration

- **Works with:** Main agent (brainstorming and implementing skills)
- **Launched by:** User, via `specdev review <phase>` in a separate session
- **Feedback loop:** Main agent uses `specdev check-review` to read and address findings
- **When to use:** Optionally after brainstorm (`specdev review brainstorm`) or implementation (`specdev review implementation`). Never between breakdown and implement — that transition is automatic
